# MetricsHour - Build Progress

## TODO — Must Not Skip (check these every session) ⚠️
These were agreed on 2026-02-21. Do not let the user move on until all are done.

### High Priority (do before next feature)
- [x] **Restore script** — deploy/restore.py. Tested end-to-end: downloads from R2, psql restore, row count verification (250 countries, 103k indicators, all tables OK). Stops/starts services automatically.
- [x] **Sentry** — FastAPI (StarletteIntegration + FastApiIntegration) + Celery (CeleryIntegration). Live and active after restart 2026-02-21.
- [x] **Rate limiting** — slowapi + Upstash Redis; 5/min on /register, 10/min on /login. Redis-backed (shared across workers). Tested and confirmed 429.
- [ ] **UptimeRobot** — set up free monitor on /health endpoint. Currently blind to outages.

### Medium Priority (do this sprint)
- [x] **Celery failure alerting** — task_failure signal in celery_app.py; always logs to /var/log/metricshour/celery-failures.log; Discord embed alert if DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL set. Covers all 5 tasks automatically. Tested.
- [x] **Wire KV cache into hot routes** — /api/countries (1hr TTL, filter-aware key) + /api/assets (5min TTL). Wired and live 2026-02-21.
- [ ] **Enable PgBouncer on Aiven** — connection pooler, prevents connection exhaustion under load.

### Later (before scaling)
- [ ] **Cloudflare Turnstile** — free CAPTCHA on /register.
- [ ] **R2 public domain** — attach custom domain to bucket if ever serving public URLs.
- [ ] **Axiom** — replace /var/log/metricshour/ with searchable log explorer (free 50GB/month, CF native).

## Next Steps 📋
1. Deploy frontend to Cloudflare Pages (see below — needs Pages API token)
2. Add custom domain in Cloudflare Pages dashboard (metricshour.com + www)

## Pending Deploy ⚡
Frontend is built (dist/ ready). Git pushed to GitHub. CF Pages deploy needs a token with Pages:Edit permission:
- dash.cloudflare.com → Profile → API Tokens → Create Token → "Edit Cloudflare Pages" template
- Then: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=<token> npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=metricshour`
- Run from: /root/metricshour/frontend/

## Known Issues 🐛
- Cloudflare Pages deploy token (CF_API_TOKEN in .env) is R2-only — lacks Pages:Edit permission
- ALLOWED_ORIGINS updated 2026-02-21: includes metricshour.com, www.metricshour.com, 2c93f583.metricshour.pages.dev, localhost:3000

## Priority Order (always follow this)
1. Celery price workers — live prices
2. UN Comtrade seeder — trade_pairs data
3. SEC EDGAR seeder — stock geo revenue (core differentiator)
4. Deploy
