## Session 2026-03-13 — Security Hardening + Bug Fixes

### Fixed
- **celery_app.py corrupted by Moltis** — module docstring embedded entire beat_schedule body. Restored from git.
- **data-quality-monitor task** — properly added to beat schedule (9am UTC daily)
- **Coolify (8090) public exposure** — Docker bypasses UFW. Fixed via DOCKER-USER iptables chain.
- **Portainer (8999, 9443) + Coolify realtime (6001, 6002)** — also exposed via Docker bypass. Fixed in docker-ufw-fix.service.
- **docker-ufw-fix.service** — systemd service runs after Docker on every boot, re-applies DOCKER-USER rules. Enabled.
- **UFW accidentally removed** during iptables-persistent install conflict. Reinstalled and reconfigured.
- **boot.mount failed** — VPS has no /boot partition. Masked the unit.
- **unattended-upgrades not running** — was blocked by boot.mount failure. Now active.
- **24 security packages outdated** — applied (libgnutls, libpam, sudo, krb5, libxml2, etc.). 0 pending.
- **CSP header missing** — added Content-Security-Policy to nginx security-headers.conf snippet.
- **Nginx rate limiting** — added zones: api_general (120r/m, burst 30), api_auth (10r/m, burst 5), api_write (30r/m). Applied to all location blocks.
- **robots.txt corrupted** by Moltis (garbage prefix). Restored from git.
- **DOCKER-USER duplicate rules** — cleaned up, now 10 clean rules.
- **Moltis max_iterations=20** — raised to 50. agent_timeout 300→600s.
- **Moltis AGENTS.md** — updated with security posture, Coolify access method, beat task list, refuse-port-open directive.
- **Junk files from Moltis** removed: celery_app.py.backup, fix_celery.py, index.vue.bak, indexOG.vue.
- **data_quality_monitor.py** (new Celery task) committed to git.
