# MetricsHour - Project Overview

## Mission
Global financial intelligence platform connecting stock prices, country economics, bilateral trade data, and commodities in ONE fast mobile-first interface.

## What Makes Us Unique
Only platform that connects:
- Stock geographic revenue exposure (which countries each stock makes money from)
- Bilateral trade flows between countries (US-China trade deficit, etc)
- Country macroeconomic indicators (GDP, inflation, growth rates)
- Commodities data (oil, gold, metals affecting stocks)

Competitors have pieces. We have the complete picture.

## The Problem We Solve
**Before MetricsHour:** To understand "How does US-China trade tension affect my Apple stock?" requires:
- Yahoo Finance (stock price)
- Trading Economics (macro data)
- UN Comtrade (trade data)
- SEC EDGAR (geographic revenue)
- 30+ minutes manual research across 4 sites

**With MetricsHour:** One page, 30 seconds. All data connected.

## Business Model

## The 14-Day Launch Rule
Launch in 14 days maximum. No exceptions. Ugly and live beats perfect and offline.
MVP = G20 countries (20 countries) + top 100 stocks + top 380 trade pairs + top 20 commodities.
Everything else built AFTER user validation and feedback.

## Non-Negotiable Rules (Read These)
1. Launch in 14 days maximum
2. Never build features without 3 users requesting first
3. Post daily data insight on Twitter/X (consistency compounds)
4. Publish minimum 1 SEO article per week (3/week is winning)
5. Talk to 3 users every week via 30-min interviews
6. Show data sources on every page (transparency builds trust)
7. Never show stale data as current (display N/A before wrong data)
8. Keep day job until $3,000 MRR (financial pressure = bad decisions)
9. Respond to every user message within 24 hours
10. Master one marketing channel before starting another
